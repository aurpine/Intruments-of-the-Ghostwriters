Hello stranger! I'm Herbert George 
Wells, better known as H.G. Wells.
I was born September 21, 1866 and 
died August 13, 1946. I was famous 
for being a Science Fiction writer 
and wrote many books such as 
"The War of the Worlds", 
"The Time Machine" and 
"The Island of Doctor Moreau". 
You've made it far, but as I once 
said, the only true measure of success
is the ratio between what we might have
done and what we might have been on the
one hand, and the thing we have made 
and the things we have made of ourselves
on the other.So, young explorer, you have
made it this far but you must answer one
question to proceed…
