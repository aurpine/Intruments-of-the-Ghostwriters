Hey there freind! I'm Stephen Edwin 
King, born on September 21, 1947. 
Thankfully, unlike those other clowns,
I'm still alive. To this day I write 
some of the worlds best horror and 
suspense stories. You may of heard of 
some of my works such as "The Shining",
"The Stand", "The Dark Tower". Looks 
like you’re doing well, but the trust of 
the innocent is the liar’s most useful 
tool. I’m surprised you survived my world
of horror, now answer my question and 
I’ll let you pass.
