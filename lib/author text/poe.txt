Deep into that darkness peering, long 
I stood there, wondering, fearing, 
doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal 
ever dared to dream before... Hello 
traveler, I am Edgar Allan Poe, I was 
born January 19, 1809 and died a sad 
death on October 7, 1849. I wrote 
Mysteries and Short stories during 
my time as a writer and was very 
influential to literature creating 
the structure of many pieces of modern 
writing. Some of my famous books are 
"The Raven", "The Fall of the House of 
Usher", and "The Tell-Tale Heart". 
But oh how I ever wallow in my sorrow, 
if only someone were to save me from 
this wretched life. Go on adventurer, 
answer this question, or your life 
shall become as horrid as mine!
