Ho there adventurer, come hither 
and I shall baffle you with a conundrum!
I am William Shakespeare, known to 
have entered this world in the month 
of April 1564 and to have left its warm 
grasp on April 23, 1616. I was a playwrite 
specializing in the art of tragedy and 
comedy. You've no doubt heard of some of 
plays, including "Hamlet", "Macbeth" and 
"Romeo and Juliet". Now if you are able 
to use your sharp wit to answer my 
question correctly you may pass!
