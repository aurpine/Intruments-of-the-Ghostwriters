		<h1>Rules</h1>
		
		<h2>About</h2>
		<p><i>Instruments of the Ghostwriters</i> is a literature based platformer. The game is about an author from the future trying to save English literature. He explores 5 different worlds based on the writings of 5 different authors. These authors are Edgar Allan Poe, Stephen King, H.G. Wells, William Shakespeare, and J.R.R. Tolkien.</p>

		<h2>Movement</h2>
		<p>The player starts out on a tutorial world where they have to learn the basics of the game; movement, jumping, checkpoints, letters, and obstacles. Movement is controlled with the 'a' and 'd' keys as well as the lift and right arrow keys. Jumping is controlled by the 'w' key, the up arrow key, and the space bar. Player’s must avoid obstacles, some of which are lethal. When players explore the worlds they will find letters, each of these letters will activate a checkpoint which is represented by a golden block. Checkpoints are certain points within a level where the player can re-spawn at after dying; they make the game much less frustrating. The letters also unlock hints for the level that can be used to solve the final puzzle of the game. The player can pick up to a maximum of 5 letters.</p>

		<h2>Solving puzzles</h2>
		<p>When a player reaches the end of a level, they are greeted by an author who gives them information about himself then presents them with a puzzle. These puzzles are quite difficult to solve without hints gotten from picking up letters but are not impossible. When a player correctly answers the question for a level, their high score for that level is saved.</p>
		
		<h2>Score</h2>
		<p>A player’s score is calculated by level. The factors taken into consideration are number of attempts, time spent, and number of letters.</p>
		
		<h2>Progression, difficulty and level selection</h2>
		<p>There are several options available to the player to start the game. The player can start a new game and progress through the story starting at the tutorial level and progressing on the other, harder worlds. The player can also choose the world select option where all 5 worlds are available to be played. Each world has a different difficulty; World 1 - tutorial, World 2 - easy, World 3 - medium, World 4 - hard, World 5 - nightmare.</p>

		<h2>Character Selection</h2>
		<p>The character that the player can choose to play as is quite customizable. First the player must choose a name then they can choose from 12 different colour combinations to be able to play the game the way that they like.</p>
